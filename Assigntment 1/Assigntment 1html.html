        <p>You call me, all friendly, tellin' me how much you miss me
            That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
            Well, I'm too busy for your business, go find a girl who wants to listen
            'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
        </p>
        <p>So I cut you off, I don't need your love
            'Cause I already cried enough
            I've been done, I've been movin' on
            Since we said goodbye
            I cut you off, I don't need your love
            So you can try all you want
            Your time is up, I'll tell you why
        </p>
        <p>You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
            So save it, get gone, shut up
            'Cause if you think I care about you now
            Well, boy, I don't give a -
        </p>
        <p>I remember that weekend when my best friend caught you creepin'
            You blamed it all on the alcohol
            So, I made my decision 'cause you made your bed, sleep in it
            Play the victim and switch your position, I'm through, I'm done
        </p>
        <p>So I cut you off, I don't need your love
            'Cause I already cried enough
            I've been done, I've been movin' on
            Since we said goodbye
            I cut you off, I don't need your love
            So you can try all you want
            Your time is up, I'll tell you why
        </p>
        <p>
            You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
            So save it, get gone, shut up
            'Cause if you think I care about you now
            Well, boy, I don't give a -
        </p>
        <p>
            I see you tryna get to me
            I see you beggin' on your knees
            Boy, I don't give a -
            So stop tryna get to me
            Get up off your knees, 'cause
            Boy, I don't give a -, uh, uh
        </p>
        <p>
            About you, no, I don't give a damn
            You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
            But I'm over you, now you're all in the past
            You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
        </p>
        <p>
            Cut you off, I don't need your love
            So you can try all you want
            Your time is up, I'll tell you why
            I'll tell you why
